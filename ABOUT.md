# About DoubleColorProgressBar

DoubleColorProgressBar is a PySide6-based custom widget designed to enhance user interface feedback. It combines a primary progress indicator with a secondary animation overlay, giving a dynamic and visually appealing way to represent progress.

### Key Highlights

- **Encapsulation of Repeated Logic**: Common calculations for progress ratios and UI regions are neatly encapsulated in helper functions.
- **Partial Repainting**: Utilizes Qt's clipping feature to redraw only the modified parts, increasing performance.
- **Consistent Naming & Structure**: Clear separation between the main progress (_value1_) and the animation (_animation_value_), along with unified naming for related variables.
- **Robust Value Validation**: Range checking added to ensure that inputs remain within acceptable bounds.
- **Timer Control Abstraction**: Centralizes the management of QTimer for easier maintenance and readability.

Designed for developers who want an enhanced progress display for their desktop applications, DoubleColorProgressBar provides a flexible and modular solution that is both efficient and easy to integrate.
